> **Last Updated:** April 2026
> **Status:** Authoritative
> **Guiding Principle:** Architecture is constant. Scope, depth, and operational proof evolve.
> **Companion:** [Architecture Blueprint](./architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
> **Companion Skill:** [Vue 3 Abren ERP Development](../.agents/skills/vue3-abren-erp/SKILL.md)

## 1. Why this roadmap exists

This roadmap governs the delivery of the Abren ERP frontend. In an architecture-first project, the UI is more than a set of features—it is the **primary validator** of the backend's hardened backbone.

Its job is to track:
- **Architectural Integrity (Vertical)**: Adherence to the 4-layer architecture, Mapper-as-Factory, and Zod-shielded adapters.
- **Functional Scope (Horizontal)**: The breadth of business modules usable by the end-user.
- **Operational Proof**: The verification that backend capabilities (idempotency, temporal determinism, audit) actually work in a real-world user flow.

## 2. The Implementation Model

### 2.1 Vertical Integrity vs. Horizontal Scope

A module is not "Done" just because it has a page. It must meet the **Vertical Integrity Gate**:

| Layer | Requirement | Status Check |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Infrastructure** | **Zod Shielding** | Are DTOs parsed by Zod schemas to catch backend drift? |
| **Infrastructure** | **Mapper-as-Factory** | Is the raw DTO transformed into a high-integrity Domain Entity? |
| **Application** | **Query Key Factories** | Are query keys centralized to prevent silent cache drift? |
| **Application** | **Strict API Typing** | Does the composable use `useApiQuery`/`useApiMutation` with precise error types? |
| **UI** | **Feedback Loops** | Does the UI show global success/error toasts (`vue-sonner`) and loading states? |

### 2.2 Operational Proof Gates

Before a Horizon is called "Consolidated," every backend capability must be proven end-to-end:
1. **Idempotency**: UI generates UUID7 keys for every mutation.
2. **Temporal Determinism**: UI passes explicit `now` context where required.
3. **Observability**: UI propagates `X-Request-ID` (handled by shared HTTP client).
4. **Audit**: UI actions are correctly attributed to the `CurrentUser`.

## 3. Ordered Transition Horizons

| Horizon | Aim | Primary Frontend Goal |
|---------|-----|-----------------------|
| **Horizon A — Backbone Consolidation** | Operational Proof of the Core | 100% Functional CRUD for Core, Ledger, and AP (PR/VB) |
| **Horizon B — Domain Expansion** | Support Operational Business Flows | Procurement, Sales, HR, and Fixed Assets UI |
| **Horizon C — Intelligence & Consolidation** | Multi-entity and Analytical Depth | Group Reporting, IAS 21 Translation UI, Cashflow Projections |
| **Horizon D — Production Operating Posture** | Scalability & Resilience | Advanced Session Management, Error Boundaries, PWA support |

## 4. Current Status: Horizon A (Backbone Consolidation)

### 4.1 Core Operating System (Backend Stage 1)
| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Identity (Users/Roles List) | ✅ | Verified against live API |
| Tenant Context | ✅ | Hydration working on reload |
| Dashboard Stat Cards | 🔨 | Currently hardcoded; needs API integration |
| User Profile Management | 📋 | Planned for Phase 2 |

### 4.2 Financial Engine (Backend Stage 2)
| Subdomain | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Ledger** | 🔨 | CoA list ✅; Account Create/Edit 📋; Settings ✅ |
| **Fiscal Periods** | 📋 | List ✅; Create/Open action 📋 |
| **Journal Entries** | 🔨 | List ✅; Balanced Create Form 📋; Post action 📋 |
| **AP (Requests)** | ✅ | Full Lifecycle: Create → Submit → Approve |
| **AP (Bills)** | 🔨 | List ✅; Validation/Rejection action 📋 |
| **Bank** | 🔨 | List ✅; Transaction history ✅ |

## 5. Sequencing Rule: "No Breadth on Unstable Seams"

The UI will not add new modules (e.g., Procurement) until the supporting seams (Ledger, Workflows, Identity) are **Consolidated** and **Verified**.

### Exit Criteria for Horizon A:
1. **Zero hardcoded strings** in the primary business flow.
2. **100% DTO sync** with the runtime OpenAPI spec.
3. **Global feedback system** (Toasts) active for all mutations.
4. **Dashboard** accurately reflects system state.

## 6. Cleanup & Technical Debt

| Task | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Regenerate types from live API | **P0** | High drift detected |
| Consolidate Branded Types | ✅ | Done |
| Install `vue-sonner` | **P1** | Replaces basic Toast |
| Replace inline styles in CoA grid | **P1** | Blueprint Violation |
